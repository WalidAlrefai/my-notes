# Learn the fundamentals of a good developer

Working under pressure and not working in the right way leads to the developer thinking in bad terms that discourage his intentions and this leads to problems in the workflow, so this problem must be solved by developing some concepts for the developer.
Here are some of the key points that every developer should master:

  1. **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**

   The developer must envision the way the program works in a good way so that its purpose is of benefit to people
     ***Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are.-[Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Simplicity-Fundamentals-Max-Kanat-Alexander-ebook/dp/B007NZU848)***

  2. **The Goals of Software Design**
     
     Every programmer is a designer.
     When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work”,Therefore, developers must make programs more effective and helpful to users, and this increases the life and effectiveness of the program.   
       ***To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible. — [Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Simplicity-Fundamentals-Max-Kanat-Alexander-ebook/dp/B007NZU848).***

  3. **(Mis)understanding**
    Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.
        ***Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. — [Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Simplicity-Fundamentals-Max-Kanat-Alexander-ebook/dp/B007NZU848)***

  4. **Simplicity**
     *Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci.*
     Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers,
